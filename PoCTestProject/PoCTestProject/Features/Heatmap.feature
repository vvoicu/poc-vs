Feature: Heatmap
	In order to avoid silly mistakes
	As a math idiot
	I want to be told the sum of two numbers

Scenario: Add two numbers
	Given I navigate to the login URL
	And I enter valid credentials
	When I go to heatmap
	And I click on a colored square
	Then I am redirected to the requirements page
	And the number of requirements is correct for each color
